# Class-and-Objects
## Aim:
To use and implement C++ classes and objects.

## Software used:
Visual studio code.

## Theory
Classes
Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class is essentially a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functions that operate on the data into a single unit.
### Objects
An object is an instance of a class. When you define a class, you create a blueprint for objects. Once the class is defined, you can create objects that follow the structure and behavior defined by the class.
## Algorithms
Defining class and objects
Start

Class Definition:
Define a class named student with the following public data members:

string name: To store the student's name.
int age: To store the student's age.
string branch: To store the student's branch of study.
float result: To store the student's result.
int year: To store the student's current academic year.
int prn: To store the student's PRN (Personal Registration Number).
Main Function:
Declare two objects s1 and s2 of the class student.

Input and Output for First Student (s1):
Assign the following values to the object s1:

name = "Amey"
age = 19
branch = "ENTC"
prn = 019
result = 8.4
year = 2
Display the values stored in s1:
Print the name, age, branch, prn, result, and year.
Input and Output for Second Student (s2):
Assign the following values to the object s2:

name = "Anushka"
age = 19
branch = "ENTC"
prn = 025
result = 8.3
year = 2
Display the values stored in s2:
Print the name, age, branch, prn, result, and year.
End

Defining Method in class
Start

Class Definition:

Define a class named student.
Inside the class, define a public method named myMethod():
This method outputs the message: "I am studying in 2nd year.".
Main Function:

Declare an object s1 of the class student.

Method Invocation:

Call the myMethod() function using the object s1.
Output:

The program prints the message "I am studying in 2nd year.".
End
